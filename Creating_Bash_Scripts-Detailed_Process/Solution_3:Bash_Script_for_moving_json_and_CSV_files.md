### Question 3:
**PS:** 

* I chose to work with the CSV files in the **raw** folder

* I also created a sample JSON file in the raw folder that will be used to simulate this task. Use `touch temp_file.json` to create a sample json file.

* Create a bash script file that will hold the script to move all CSV and JSON files to a folder called **json_and_CSV**.

    `touch  move_files.sh`

* Run `chmod +x move_files.sh` to make the script executable.

* Use nano to open the `move_files.sh` file and write the script for the task. Press `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit. 

* The well-detailed **script** that was used to move the csv and json files in the raw folder to the json_and_CSV folder can be found [here](/root/CoreDataEngineers/LinuxGitAssignment/Scripts/Bash/move_files.sh).

* Now, execute the script by running `./move_files.sh`.
