## ðŸŒŸGeting your Linux Environment Ready
It'd be nice to remember that all solution to the personal assignment uses bash scripting, and this means you would be working in a linux environment in order to use bash scripting.

#### Option 1: Use GitBash
So, first things first would be to download [GitBash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USZqL4QDXjU) (this gives you a pseudo-linux terminal) and Git terminal.

#### Option 2: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux

Or if you are more experienced, you can use **Windows Subsystem for Linux.** Kindly use this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to install and setup WSL on windows if you like reading articles or this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJWhyycbPyA) if you prefer watching videos. 

#### Option 3: (If you are more experienced)
You can use a **virtual machine** (which installs a Linux OS on your windows system). Watch a video on how to install a Linux VM with this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhVjgI57Ino).

#### Option for MacOS Users 
Use this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mf3l8z6oxQ0) to install Git on your system, you do not need to install a linux terminal (MacOS comes with a linux terminal by default)


**N.B:** Linux users do not need to install Git or any terminal.
